## Why
To expand the game library with "Pentago", a strategic game involving spatial reasoning and board manipulation (rotation), providing a unique challenge compared to existing games.

## What Changes
- Add new game module: `pentago`
- Implement game logic (6x6 board, quadrant rotation, 5-in-a-row win check).
- Implement UI with marble placement and rotation controls.
- Register Pentago in the main portal.

## Impact
- New capability: `pentago`
- Affected files: `src/games/pentago/*`, `src/styles/pentago.css`, `index.html`
